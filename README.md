A script that allows you to sort and find the best pics among several by **pairwise comparison**. Just drop a bunch of pics into the browser and click `Compare` button to start. The script runs locally, your pics are not uploaded to any server.

Don't drop too many pics at once. The script does about `log2(n!)` comparisons!

The code is a bit messy, it was written by my cat üê±

[Have a good comparison!](https://reserved-word.github.io/cat-pic-sorter/)
